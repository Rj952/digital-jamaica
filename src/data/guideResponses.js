  portland: {
    keywords: ["portland", "port antonio"],
    response: "Portland is Jamaica's lushest parish — nicknamed the 'garden parish' for its incredible rainforest and waterfalls. It's home to the original jerk cooking tradition, born in the Blue Mountains where the Maroons seasoned and slow-smoked meat over pimento wood. The Rio Grande rafting tradition was started by Errol Flynn, who fell in love with the area. Port Antonio was once one of the most glamorous destinations in the Caribbean.\n\nPortland people are known for their warmth, storytelling tradition, and deep connection to the land. The parish has a mystical quality — waterfalls hidden in rainforest, the famous Blue Lagoon, and Reach Falls. Moore Town, a Windward Maroon community where Queen Nanny once led, is still an active cultural centre.\n\nFor your child: Portland is like a real-life fairy tale — imagine a place where waterfalls hide in forests, the water in the Blue Lagoon changes colour, and people cook the most delicious chicken over wood fires in the mountains. It's the greenest, most magical part of Jamaica!"

  "1970": {
    keywords: ["1970", "seventies", "70s"],
    response: "The 1970s in Jamaica were electric and turbulent — perhaps the most transformative decade in the nation's history.\n\nMichael Manley was elected Prime Minister in 1972 on a platform of democratic socialism. He brought free education, land reform, the minimum wage, and the national minimum voting age of 18. But his policies also brought economic crisis, as foreign investment fled and the IMF arrived with structural adjustment.\n\nPolitical violence escalated between PNP and JLP supporters, turning Kingston's garrisons into war zones. The 1976 election campaign was Jamaica's most violent.\n\nBut culturally? The 1970s were extraordinary. Bob Marley released Catch a Fire, Burnin', Natty Dread, Rastaman Vibration, and Exodus. The Smile Jamaica concert in December 1976 happened just days after Marley was shot at his home on Hope Road. The One Love Peace Concert in 1978 saw Marley bring Manley and Seaga together on stage.\n\nReggae became the voice of the Third World. Dub music was invented. Kingston's dancehalls were revolutionary spaces. Jamaicans migrated in waves to Miami, New York, Toronto, and London.\n\nIt was the decade that shaped modern Jamaica — creative genius alongside deep struggle."

    keywords: ["saying", "patois", "expression", "proverb", "phrase", "creole"],

  reggae: {
    keywords: ["reggae", "music begin", "music start", "music origin"],
    response: "Reggae emerged around 1968 from the evolution of ska → rocksteady → reggae, each genre slowing down the tempo and deepening the bass.\n\nThe one-drop drum pattern — emphasizing the third beat with bass drum and snare simultaneously — became reggae's signature heartbeat. Toots Hibbert of Toots & the Maytals is credited with first using the word 'reggae' in the song 'Do the Reggay' (1968).\n\nBut it was Bob Marley who made reggae a global force. Starting with The Wailers (with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer), Marley took the music from Kingston's studios to the world stage. His deal with Island Records' Chris Blackwell in 1972 was the turning point.\n\nThe music was inseparable from Rastafari, Pan-Africanism, and anti-colonial resistance. Studios like Studio One (Coxsone Dodd), Channel One (the Hookim brothers), and the Black Ark (Lee 'Scratch' Perry) were sacred spaces where the sound was crafted.\n\nProducers like Lee 'Scratch' Perry and King Tubby were as important as the artists — they invented dub, which pioneered remix culture decades before electronic music.\n\nReggae gave voice to the sufferers and became the sound of liberation movements from South Africa to East Timor. In 2018, UNESCO inscribed reggae music as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity."

  maroon: {
    keywords: ["maroon", "nanny", "cudjoe", "accompong"],
    response: "The Maroons are among the most remarkable freedom fighters in world history.\n\nWhen the British invaded Jamaica in 1655, enslaved Africans held by the Spanish fled to the mountains and formed free communities. They waged guerrilla warfare against the British Empire for nearly 80 years — and won.\n\nQUEEN NANNY led the Windward Maroons in the Blue Mountains. A military strategist and spiritual leader, she is said to have used knowledge of herbs and African spiritual practices alongside brilliant guerrilla tactics. She is Jamaica's only female National Hero and appears on the $500 note.\n\nCUDJOE led the Leeward Maroons in the impenetrable Cockpit Country of western Jamaica. His fighters used the terrain — sinkholes, caves, and dense forest — to ambush British troops repeatedly.\n\nThe British, unable to defeat them, signed peace treaties in 1739-1740 granting the Maroons land and autonomous self-governance.\n\nToday, Maroon communities remain:\n• Accompong (St. Elizabeth) — Leeward Maroons, annual festival January 6\n• Moore Town (Portland) — Windward Maroons\n• Charles Town (Portland)\n• Scott's Hall (St. Mary)\n\nThey maintain distinct cultural traditions, governance structures (led by a Colonel), Kromanti language fragments, and the Abeng (cow horn) used for communication across mountains."

  jonkonnu: {
    keywords: ["jonkonnu", "john canoe", "junkanoo", "christmas tradition"],
    response: "Jonkonnu (also spelled John Canoe or Junkanoo) is one of Jamaica's oldest cultural traditions — a masquerade celebration rooted in West African masking traditions that adapted to survive during slavery.\n\nTraditionally performed on December 26 (Boxing Day) and into the New Year, Jonkonnu features elaborate costumed characters:\n\n🎭 KEY CHARACTERS:\n• Pitchy-Patchy — Covered in strips of colourful fabric, dancing wildly\n• Horse Head — A performer with a horse head structure, charging through crowds\n• Devil — Horned and menacing, representing spiritual forces\n• Belly Woman — Exaggerated pregnant belly, comic and earthy\n• King & Queen — Elaborate royal costumes\n• Amerindian — Feathered headdress, honouring Taino presence\n\nThe parade is accompanied by fife and drum music, with performers dancing through communities. During slavery, Jonkonnu was one of the few times enslaved people were allowed to celebrate freely — masters would give time off during the Christmas period.\n\nThe tradition has declined significantly but is being revived through cultural organizations and schools. The Jamaica Cultural Development Commission works to keep Jonkonnu alive.\n\nFor children: Jonkonnu is Jamaica's own masquerade party — imagine colourful characters dancing through the streets at Christmas time, with drums playing and everyone coming out to watch and join in!"
  },
  parish: {
    keywords: ["parish system", "parish", "14 parishes", "counties"],
    response: "Jamaica is divided into 14 parishes — administrative divisions similar to counties or states. They're grouped into three historic counties:\n\n🟡 SURREY (East): Kingston, St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland\n🟢 MIDDLESEX (Central): St. Mary, St. Ann, Clarendon, Manchester, St. Catherine\n🔴 CORNWALL (West): Trelawny, St. James, Hanover, Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth\n\nEach parish has its own identity and character. Jamaicans strongly identify with their parish — asking 'Where yuh come from?' (which parish) is one of the first questions when Jamaicans meet.\n\nLargest by population: St. Catherine (516,000+)\nSmallest by population: Hanover (69,500)\nLargest by area: St. Ann (1,213 sq km)\n\nParish rivalries are real — especially in sports (Manning Cup football, ISSA track & field). Schools from different parishes compete fiercely, and parish pride runs deep in the diaspora too."

  food: {
    keywords: ["food", "cuisine", "ackee", "jerk", "cooking"],
    response: "Jamaican food tells the story of every people who touched the island — and the result is one of the world's most flavorful cuisines.\n\n🏺 TAINO ROOTS: Bammy (cassava bread), pepperpot, and barbecue techniques\n🌍 AFRICAN FOUNDATION: Ackee (brought from West Africa on slave ships), callaloo, and one-pot cooking traditions\n🇪🇸 SPANISH/PORTUGUESE: Escovitch fish (from 'escabeche'), certain pastry techniques\n🇬🇧 BRITISH: Sunday roast dinner tradition, pastry influence on patties\n🇮🇳 INDIAN: Curry goat, roti, doubles influence — arrived with indentured workers after 1845\n🇨🇳 CHINESE: Stir-fry techniques, influence on 'chow mein' becoming a Jamaican staple\n\n🔥 WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE:\n• Scotch bonnet pepper — the heat signature of Jamaican cooking\n• Allspice (pimento) — Jamaica produces most of the world's supply\n• The jerk tradition — Maroon-originated smoking technique\n• One-pot cooking — stews, soups, and the Sunday rice & peas\n• Fresh herbs — thyme, scallion, and ginger in almost everything\n\nJamaican food isn't just nutrition — it's identity. Sunday dinner (rice & peas, chicken, salad) is sacred. Christmas dinner (curry goat, sorrel, fruit cake) is non-negotiable. A 'plate' at a community event is a social currency."

  hero: {
    keywords: ["national hero", "heroes", "heroine"],
    response: "Jamaica has seven National Heroes — the highest honour the nation bestows. Their faces appear on Jamaica's currency:\n\n🌍 MARCUS GARVEY (1887–1940) — $20 note\nFounded UNIA, the largest Pan-African movement in history. His philosophy of Black self-determination influenced the civil rights movement and Rastafari.\n\n🏔️ QUEEN NANNY (c.1686–c.1755) — $500 note\nLeader of the Windward Maroons.

  rastafari: {
    keywords: ["rastafari", "rasta", "haile selassie", "dreadlock"],
    response: "Rastafari is a spiritual and cultural movement born in Jamaica in the 1930s — one of Jamaica's most significant contributions to world culture.\n\n🦁 ORIGINS:\nAfter Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I (born Ras Tafari Makonnen) was crowned in 1930, Jamaican preachers like Leonard Howell, Joseph Hibbert, and Archibald Dunkley saw the fulfilment of Marcus Garvey's prophecy: 'Look to Africa, when a Black king shall be crowned.' Selassie became the returned Messiah in Rastafari belief.\n\n🌿 KEY PRINCIPLES:\n• Haile Selassie as divine figure\n• Africa (especially Ethiopia) as Zion / spiritual homeland\n• Babylon — the oppressive Western system\n• Ital living — natural, unprocessed food and lifestyle\n• Dreadlocks — inspired by the Nazarite vow (Numbers 6:5)\n• Nyabinghi drumming — sacred music and meditation\n• Reasoning — communal discussion and spiritual reflection\n\n🎵 CULTURAL IMPACT:\nRastafari gave birth to reggae music. Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Burning Spear made Rastafari philosophy global. The red, gold, and green colours, dreadlocks, and reggae rhythms became symbols of resistance and spirituality worldwide.\n\nRastafari is practiced on every continent and has influenced music, art, language, and social movements globally. In Jamaica, Rastas faced decades of persecution before gaining cultural acceptance."

  sport: {
    keywords: ["sport", "athletics", "track", "usain", "bolt", "cricket", "football"],
    response: "Jamaica's sporting achievements are extraordinary for a nation of under 3 million people.\n\n⚡ TRACK & FIELD — Jamaica's global dominance:\n• Usain Bolt — 8 Olympic gold medals, world records in 100m (9.58s) and 200m (19.19s)\n• Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce — Multiple Olympic and World Championship gold medals\n• Elaine Thompson-Herah — Double-double Olympic sprint champion\n• Trelawny parish produces sprinters at an impossible rate\n• The Inter-Schools Boys' & Girls' Championships (Champs) is the world's largest high school track meet — and Jamaica's Super Bowl\n\n🏏 CRICKET — deeply embedded in Jamaican culture. Sabina Park in Kingston is the home ground. Jamaica produces West Indies players regularly.\n\n⚽ FOOTBALL — the Reggae Boyz qualified for the 1998 World Cup in France, uniting the nation. Women's football (Reggae Girlz) qualified for the 2019 and 2023 World Cups under Bob Marley's daughter Cedella.\n\n🏀 NETBALL — Jamaica's Sunshine Girls are consistently ranked in the world's top 5.\n\n🏊 BOBSLED — The 1988 Jamaican bobsled team inspired the movie 'Cool Runnings.' Jamaica continues to compete in Winter Olympics.\n\nSports in Jamaica isn't just recreation — it's the primary pathway out of poverty for many young people. School rivalries (Kingston College vs Jamaica College, Calabar vs TC) are legendary."
